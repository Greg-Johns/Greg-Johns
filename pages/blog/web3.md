## Web 3 too Me
<time>May. 4th, 2022</time>

Web 3, WWW3, W3, ... What is it? Is it a big ponzi scheme? Is it the future? Or is it ...

### World War Web

  So what's going on?

For sure, I don't know but as someone who's been through a few crypto cycles, Web 2, the internet bubble and Web 1 of course I would like to find out. I'll try to post some about what I find along the way and am giving myself **bad writers license** now so that won't be a blocker for me and hopefully, besides being writing exercise for myself it might be useful to the stray web traveler somewhere out there.

#### Nabster, Cryptography & Decentralization

As a techie my interest in blockchain's, smart contracts and the web 3's starts from my more science side f mind. I'm not sure the year I heard about bitcoin but it was around the time I had been using ***Git*** for a while that got me looking into Merkle tree's, I remember the Napster music sharing peer to peer revolution and had tinkered with some real-time socket connections in Node so when I read the white paper It made sense.  A lot of sense, shoot I still remember John Perry Barlow's call. I didn't really do anything at the time I just remember thinking it was a great idea and if I wasn't such a lazy, no good whatever then I should buy some. That's not the point. The point is it made a lot of sense so when Ethereum came along with not only the ability to make programable, decentralized "money" value but could also store and run code and therefore anything that can be represented in code, it a trustless environment then consider mind = blown.

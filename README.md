### Stuff about Greg

This is the personal website of Greg Johns. I work as a senior software engineer for CBRE with a background in art and visual design. I have been building stuff on the web for over 20 years, way before it was cool back when it was just the web 1, the read-only, table based sites of the late 90's. 

I've kept a personal site of some form up for about as long as I've worked in this space and this is that site. My online collection of favorite projects, writings and other random stuff. I like to maintain a personal site  because it was one of the first things that attracted me to the web oh so long ago and for some amount of self satisfaction that comes writing. Also, it helps give me an outlet for my own personal expressions and to get away from all the conformity that comes with working on large web projects with specific business needs.


Something about myself, I would like to think that I'm a passionate creator, builder and tinkerer of things. Most virtual some real. Some useful some not so much. I've worked for mom & pop shops to big corp America. First as a user experience designer and later as a software engineer. Aside from work I have a beautiful wife and daughter, two cats and a dog that keep. I like being outdoors when I'm not with a computer where I'm ether working or somewhere down a crypto rabbit hole.

### Stuff about Greg

This is the personal website of Greg Johns. I work as a senior software engineer for CBRE with a background in art and visual design. I have been building stuff on the web for over 20 years.

I've kept a personal site of some form up for about as long as I've worked on the web and this is that site. My online collection of favorite projects, writings and other random stuff. I still enjoy maintaining a personal site, it was one of the first things that attracted me to the web oh so long ago and for the self gratification that comes with writing. Also, it helps give me an outlet for my own personal expressions and to get away from all the conformity that comes with working on large web projects with specific business needs.


Something about myself is that I am a passionate life long learner, tinkerer and builder of stuff. Most virtual some real, some useful some not so much but all stuff. I've worked for mom & pop shops to big corp America. First as a user experience designer and later as a software engineer. Aside from work I have a beautiful wife and daughter, two cats and a dog that keep me busy.

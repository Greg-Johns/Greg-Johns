#### The Renisaunce of generative art

I'm genuinly excited for the generative art (GA) movement that I see happening today.

As I wrote in [Node Gardens](./nodegardens), one of the concepts generative art (GA) introduces is that of ***chaos*** or randomness within a system. Their is a lot of ways an artist can think about working with randomness within their work, but it wasn't until I started using code and computational randomness in my work that I realy started to understand how beutiful and valuable chaos can be within art and life.

I always enjoyed painting with water colors because it felt more exploritory in how the brush interacted with the paint. How you could push certian desired effects with a skilled brush stroke and sometime the water and the texture of the canvas decided. GA was a way to open the unpradictable element to new possabilities in art.

The columns series is the last I made with the Node Garden code base back in the early 00's. A the time I worked in an R&D department for a large tech company doing design and prototype work where they encouraged my creative whims and I continued to experiment with Processing and even tried to get a dual show going at one point with another artist and co-worker but I left the company soon afterward and we fell out of contact. My new job along with the grind of daily life whould take me further away from idea driven prototype coding to work on large scale production apps where tests and best practices take presidence over clever creative coding.

## Screens & UX
<time>Nov. 16th, 2023</time>

A lot of my earlier work centered around interface design and the user experience. This is still a large part of my work but now more in a technical architect role to unique interaction concepts that arise in application development. Below are some hi-fidelity PhotoShop comps for various Verizon projects I worked on.

    "Fios Video Store Playstation application screen shot.",
    "Browsing media in the FiOS interface.",
    "Screen shot of media detail view.",
    "Browsing through music media on FiOS.",
    "Playing music while watching TV because why not.",
    "Two renderings of a concept remote control for the FiOS TV service.",
    "Some TV remote concept scetches.",
    "Image discribing remote control/TV interface interactions.",
    "Details for TV interface.",
    "View your movie rating through FiOS TV interface.",
    "Rating movies through FiOS TV interface.",
    "Facebook integration of FiOS media rating service.",
    "FiOS - Watch list browser concept screen.",
    "Initial screen for music browser interface. Blank rectangels represent album art.",
    "Vertical scrolling fans media out into an S type curve.",
    "As you scroll the the S curve streaches out to show more of the cover art.",
    "Eventually displaying the first letter of the media at that point in the curve.",
    "The faster user scroll the straighter the curve gets while showing more of the cover art.",

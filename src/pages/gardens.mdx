## More Generative Gardening
<time>Aug 14th, 2023</time>

A few more renderings from the [Node Garden](./nodegardens) code base broken out into a couple of series of sketches that focused on patterns of colorful waves and spirals. These sketches where made back in the early 2000's and have remained on an old hardrive unseen by anyone. Until now. I couldn't quite bring myself to delete them so I've posted them here to remain unseen on my website. Ahhh, much better.

## Sites
<time>Nov 16th, 2023</time>

As I started working on the web soon after Tim Berners Lee released it to the wide world, I have worked on more sites than I can remember over the years. Below are images from some of those sites ordered by year. I put this up not so much for a portfolio of great design or engagment metrics but more so I can ***scroll*** down memory lane.

The following images are from the last batch of outputs I made with the original NG codebase and some of my favorite pieces. As far as generative art goes, I've recently got involved with the Artblocks community and had the chance to personaly thank Eric Snofro for helping bring generative art back in favor along with finding novel ways to integrate in with blockchains.

For me, my work with Processing and creative coding was the last stop on my artistic journey. Also some time around 2010 I would tranistion from working as a designer/protype developer to a frontend developer then fullstack and implementing others design and UX work. This was all by choice as I had grown tired of working as a creative in a corporate environment and also like the technical challenge of it all. This doesn't mean I still don't like to design or create art. That's what this site is for ;)  Stay tuned, more to come.

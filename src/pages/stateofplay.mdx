## The State of Play
<time>May 17th, 2023</time>

> I happily played World of Warcraft during 2007-2010, but one day Blizzard removed the damage component from my beloved warlock's Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring.
> - Vitalik Buterin

In the face of such horrable centralized game servers, what does the bright young Vitalik do? He invents Ehtheruem a decentralized, trustless gaming server that anyone can play on. Kind of.

The Ethereum white paper built upon Satoshi's bitcoin idea with smart contracts and generalized programming language that greatly expanded the crypto design space and ushered in a variety of decentralized applications but few outside of the financal type have found much user adoption.

### Defi get a gold star

If we think of Ethereum as a web of value that operates with digital tokens. Tokens that can be traded for dollars then it's easy to see why stablecoins and defi applications have been the killer app on Ethereum. 

### While Ethereum matures the design space comes to focus

With the advent of a smart contracts on blockchains the crypto design space has grown to more that financial app and the steady flow of EIP upgrades along with a growing L2 ecosystem has kept Ethereum on track if not on always on time. Work on privacy, identity usability and other key area are ongoing but as time goes by the application design space narrows to those use cases that can gain adoption and the financialization or tokenization is hard to ignore. Where is the fun in that?

### Play ball
What about the state of play on Ethereum? Isn't games why Vitalik got into blockchains in the first place? To find our answers let's first answer the question, what constitutes a Crypto game? Here we can see different degrees to on-chain games from keeping some game assets on-chain to having all game assest as well as the game logic on-chain. These early on-chain game designs are just that "early" and will need time to find what works best but one key advantage of decentralized games is the composability with other games and on-chain services. Loot is a good example of this where the loot owner esentialy owns some word registered on-chain for example the word "sword" that can be used or composed into any crypto game for swashbuckling fun and swishy sound effects.

### Where's the Metavers???
There have been some game of note in the space. CriptoKitties, God's Unchained and Dark Forest to name a few and 'Axie Infinity' with their pioneering ***Play to Earn*** model but there again is the financial integration. Which brings up the point that some outside of crypto derail the idea of bringing crytpo or any and despise the idea of P2E. I would agree with primis that "play" and "pay" don't mix well but poker would be a bore without the monies and this argument will fade as the space matures and of course there's the metaverse where games and play seem ready to take the leading roll.

### Financialization luvs Gamification
Overall My general sense is finance might not be the only killer use case for blockchains but with the ease of integrating financial incentives into any use case I can see it being a big part of most crypto games. Reciently CCP the maker of the giant online game EVE have signaled they are building on the blockchain along with NBA top Shots and others big francizes looking at the space. Quality games will take time but with new L2 comming online and transaction fees comming down we should see more experimenting more games and more play.

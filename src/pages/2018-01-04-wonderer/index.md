So much for staying on path and focused. It's been over two year's since that writing that "stay focused", "write more" crap and I only wrote one more post after that. Then nothing...

#### The timing wasn't right

I'm going to blame it on **time** which I've never seemed to catch enough of as it slips by. But this time it's  different. I can feel it. I'm going to write more.

Also, I got a newer blogger engine thing, with more new coolness. That's right, no more ~~Metalsmith~~ it's all about [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.io) now that uses the Webpack build tool, React component based front end, GraphQL data fetching and more stuff too. But this isn't about any issue with Metalsmith, I very much liked it and used it for setting up quick process pipelines for various things at work. They have a ton of plugins and good developer community that keeps it fresh. I would still use it for it's quick and simple way to set up transformation pipelines. Gatsby as I said uses Webpack for the build process with is notoriously more difficult and opinionated not to mention Gatsby more for quick setup of React based project and not as flexible or general of tool. The main reason to make the switch was more because I was looking to get a personal React project going and had been following the progress of Gatsby for a while now and liked the direction it was going.

We just celebrated the new year a few days ago when people look back through time while equally thinking about the new year to come. I would imagine that "write more" is a common resolve for people that do such things. New years resolution always seem like a self-esteem trap and I resolve not to make any. Ok, any but one. I resolve to **try** to catch more of that slippery time and write more.

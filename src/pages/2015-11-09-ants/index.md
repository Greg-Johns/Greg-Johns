#### Or Human stigmergy at work

This is my first post with a shiny new [metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) engine blog thing and without getting too lengthy, I just wanted to get something down for posterity and a bit of refocus on **why** write. The problem with thinking about "why write" can get reflective, which leads procrastination, writer's block and bad places for a writer. Sure enough I soon found myself mindlessly surfing the web.

Or so I thought. Somewhere in the winding link's I found my way to  reading a [blog article](http://bitworking.org/news/Stigmergy) from [Joe Gregorio](http://bitworking.org/news/bio) who talks about how the *Web = Stigmergy*. If your not sure what Stigmergy is, I'll pull the same quote Joe used to describe a term French biologist Pierre-Paul Grasse used to describe interaction through the environment.

> Self-Organization in social insects often requires interactions among insects: such interactions can be direct or indirect. Direct interactions are the "obvious" interactions: antennation, trophallaxis (food or liquid exchange), mandibular contact, visual contact, chemical contact (the odor of nearby nestmates), etc. Indirect interactions are more subtle: two individuals interact indirectly when one of then modifies the environment and the other responds to the new environment at a later time. Such an interaction is an example of stigmergy.

In an example he talks about how an ant use a pheremone trails to communicate food source to other ants. He goes on to claim that *The World-Wide Web is the first stimeric communication medium for humans*.

It's was all interesting and of course when I start reading quotes from old scientist then I know I'm getting somewhere. But wait... I was suppose to write something. Ok, back to my own article. Why am I writing again... Oh yeah, because I've always enjoyed it and as for as posting writing on the web I guess I'm just trying to help out any other interested ants.

> Thanks to [Blake Embrey](http://blakeembrey.com/) for putting up his help-full build pipeline that I forked for this site and I would like to add to Joe's claim that **open source** could be a binary equivalent to pheromones.

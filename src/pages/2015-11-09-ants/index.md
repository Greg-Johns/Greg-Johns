#### Wondering off path

This is my first post with a shiny new [metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) blog engine thing that let's me vim my markdown files, do all sorts of crazy source transformations and spit out clean, optimized code.

So here it is but more than just posting "something" I wanted to take this post to help me refocus on **why** I started this site in the first place. I started it was because I've always really liked [Sir Tim's idea](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html). The problem with keeping a personal site is that you need to write something to go on the site, this can be hard for the unfocused mind which leads to procrastination, writer's block and bad places for a writer. So a few minutes after sitting down to start the writing process I found myself trapped in a hyperlink wormhole.

#### A Stigmergy interaction

Somewhere in the winding link's I found my way to reading a [blog article](http://bitworking.org/news/Stigmergy) from [Joe Gregorio](http://bitworking.org/news/bio) who talks about how the *Web = Stigmergy*. If your not sure what Stigmergy is, I'll pull the same quote from French biologist Pierre-Paul Grasse that Joe used.

> Self-Organization in social insects often requires interactions among insects: such interactions can be direct or indirect. Direct interactions are the "obvious" interactions... Indirect interactions are more subtle: two individuals interact indirectly when one of then modifies the environment and the other responds to the new environment at a later time. Such an interaction is an example of stigmergy.

So basically, interaction through the environment. In an example he talks about how an ant uses pheremone trails to communicate a food source to other ants. He goes on to claim that *The World-Wide Web is the first stimeric communication medium for humans*.

It's was very interesting and I could have keep the procrastination up much longer but felt like getting back to writing something. Ok so here it is. It's very self descriptive but I was just wanting to kick the tires on Metalsmith and get back into a writing mode more than actually writing something useful and I got you use a lot of big new words.

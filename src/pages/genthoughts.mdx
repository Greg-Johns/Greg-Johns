#### The Renisaunce of generative art

I'm genuinly excited for the generative art (GA) movement that I see happening today. As I wrote in my first GA post [Node Gardens](./nodegardens) GA made me rethink my ideas on artist and art when I was able to use code for creative needs rather than corporate. I always loved painting with water colors because it felt more exploritory in how the brush interacted with the paint and how you could push certian desired effects at times and sometime the water decided. GA was a way to open the space for other 

necessitates inquiry about agency, control, and collectivity.

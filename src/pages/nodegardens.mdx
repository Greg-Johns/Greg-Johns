### Early experiments with code and art

Back when Javascript was still young and browswers where giong to war. Back when Flash spash pages where a thing. I had a love hate kind of relationship with Flash. But used it heavily for a time and could develop more advanced applications than with just HTML and JavaScrip. So When Ben Fry and Casey Rae started what they where calling Proce55ing it was an instant hit with me technicaly and also spoke to the sleeping artist in me much more than my work tool Flash. To quote there website:

 >  Proce55ing is an environment for programming images, movement, and interaction. It is a sketchbook for developing ideas, a tool for creating prototypes, and a context for learning the fundamentals of computer programming.

Writing instructions for the computer to interpret and render seemed like the digital equivalent of Sol Le Witt process of writing instruction for someone else to carry out the actual making. I was always good with making art with my hands but this seemed more exciting and I spent many hours playing around and beta testing the software.

I had been playing around with some generative type scketches in Processing when I came across the artist Jared Tarbell and his [Node Garden](http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/nodeGarden/) idea where he describes a system of interconnected “nodes” that while independent, can communicate to nearby nodes in a sort of neural network. Me and a friend worked up some code based of the post and we even gave a talk on creativity in coding for the "JavaOne" conference.

I would keep adding features and working in new ways to render the nodes relationships but due to longer render times kept the images at 500x500. I always ment to re-render some of these in larger formats for printing but never got around to it and lost the code base somewhere.

Now some 20 years later, Ethereum brings us a new kind of digital ownership with NFT's and generative art has found a place there. So I thought I would mint some of these early renderings to NFT's and put them up on some market place to see what happens.

### Early experiments with code and art

In the late 90’s at the start of the dot.com bubble when everyone was trying to get “interactive” it was corporate money that drove the web. Big corporate, commercialized, professional things needed to be built now. Microsoft and big tech where very anti-open source at the time and the web browser with it’s very new JavaScript language where still scoffed on by “serious” programmers and silly toy plugin from then Macromedia software was the only consistent way to build complex UX and interfaces. It was a crazy time for sure, I was making more money as a web designer and developer than I ever did with my art. Flash was great as a young designer but it wasn’t opensource and quickly became more for work than play.

In the early 00’s when Ben Fry and Casey Rae started Proce55ing it was a breath of freash air to me. To quote there website:

 >  Proce55ing is an environment for programming images, movement, and interaction. It is a sketchbook for developing ideas, a tool for creating prototypes, and a context for learning the fundamentals of computer programming.

Writing instructions for the computer to interpret and render was like the digital equivalent of Sol Le Witt process. It was a new creative outlet for me and I spent many hours playing around and beta testing the software.

Popular among some of the more high profile Flash based artists was an idea of a “Node Garden” by the artist Jared Tarbell where he describes a system of interconnected “nodes” that while independent, can communicate to nearby nodes in a sort of neural network.  I can’t find a link to the original article now  but it heavily influenced the way I thought about programming. I shared these ideas with a good friend and better programmer than me and together we worked up our version of the Node Garden into some processing code that we took to the JavaOne conference and gave a talk called “Creativity in Processing”.

Like a lot of side project I put it on the shelf for a while to pick it up a year or so later to re-write the idea yet again. I would work through different ideas on how to render the nodes interactions. Adding methods and variables, mix and re-mix in my garden. Then hitting render to watch it grow. The renderings could take a minute to several minutes. Over the course of a couple months I would render hundreds of 500x500 images. I don't know where I was going with all this as the stuff back then but that's the norm for most of my art.

Now some 20 years later, blockchains and Ethereum brings us a new kind of digital ownership with NFT's. Generative art back and making the scene. So I thought I would pull some of these renderings and mint them to NFT's and put them out as a series of posts. Here is some of the very early scketches to start.

## Node Farming

### Early experiments with code and art

Back when Javascript was young and browsers were at war. Back when Flash splash pages were a thing. I used Flash to build applications for work that I could'nt in just HTML and JavaScript. I was inspired by some of the Flash based artist at the time, expecially around generative art ideas but Flash was closed sourced software that went aganst my hacker mentality and always felt more work related than a tool for art. I mainly worked as a 'prototype' desinger/developer and had a lot of creative freedom on projects but ultimatly always in the service of corporations and so not the creative outlet I was looking for. When Ben Fry and Casey Rae started Proce55ing (now just Processing) that was opensource with a quick code/feedback loop it drew me in. Not only was it technically faster with more output options, it was the projects creative spirit that spoke to me and I would spend many hours beta testing and just playing with the software.

 >  Proce55ing is an environment for programming images, movement, and interaction. It is a sketchbook for developing ideas, a tool for creating prototypes, and a context for learning the fundamentals of computer programming.

Then one day I came across an article called [Node Garden](http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/nodeGarden/) by the artist Jared Tarbell where he describes ***a system of interconnected nodes that while independent, can communicate to nearby nodes in a sort of neural network.***

The way he talked about these nodes and how they could interact would wind up being a big springboard in my own experiments. I shared the article with a friend and together we came up with some code and even gave a talk on the subject at the "JavaOne" conference back in 2001 called "Creativity in Code".

I would keep adding features and working through ideas but kept the output at 500x500 to keep the render times down. The plan was to someday re-render some of better experiments into larger formats to be printed for an art showing. I created somwhere around 300 renderings that I was happy with but eventually lost the computer and source code base of these experiments but still have some of the renderings.

Now some 20 years later and my new favorite playground, Ethereum brings us a new kind of digital ownership with NFT's and projects like [ArtBlocks](https://www.artblocks.io/), generative art seems to have found new life so I thought I would mint some of these early renderings to NFT's and put them up on a NFT market place to see what happens.

The 16 sketches above are some of the earliest pieces. Back then my main objective was to use Processing and programming for just creative work and not the Flash based work I had to do on the daily. I was looking for symitries and anti-symitries in the sketches. Things that where beautifil but counter the controled hand drawn sketches I spent so much of my childhood with.

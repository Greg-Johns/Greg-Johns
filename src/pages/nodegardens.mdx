### The Sole of Sol Lewitt
Growing up with a love for art and going to art school I was aware of some early generative artist. My love of programming and computers came later after graduation and just fueled my interest in genre. One of my favorite and eariest in this generative form was [Sol Lewitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt) who would famously just write a list of instructions for someone else to execute. What you had left was the art. He beutifully separated the ***idea*** from the ***execution***. Growing up as a kid who could draw real well and played guitar I had a strong connection with art through my hands. I was always in control of physical part of creating but working out ideas in code that the computer renders was very transformative to me.

### Early experiments with code and art

Back when Javascript was young and browsers were at war. Back when Flash splash pages were a thing. I used Flash to build applications for work that I couldn't in just HTML and JavaScript. I was inspired by some of the Flash based artist at the time, expecially around generative art ideas but Flash was closed sourced software that went aganst my hacker mentality and always felt more work related than a tool for art. I mainly worked as a 'prototype' desinger/developer and had a lot of creative freedom on projects but ultimatly always in the service of corporations and so not the creative outlet I was looking for. In 2001, When Ben Fry and Casey Rae started Proce55ing (now just Processing) that was opensource with a quick code/feedback loop it drew me in. Not only was it technically faster with more output options, it was the projects creative spirit that spoke to me and I would spend many hours beta testing and just playing with the software.

 >  Proce55ing is an environment for programming images, movement, and interaction. It is a sketchbook for developing ideas, a tool for creating prototypes, and a context for learning the fundamentals of computer programming.

### Node Farming

A few years later I came across an article called [Node Garden](http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/nodeGarden/) by the artist Jared Tarbell where he describes ***a system of interconnected yet independent nodes that can communicate to nearby nodes in a sort of substrate.***

His work and the way he talked about nodes and shared nearal network was a big springboard into my own experiments with generative art. I shared the article with a friend and together we came up with some code and even gave a talk on the subject at the "JavaOne" conference back in 2008 called "Creativity in Code".

Over time I would keep adding features and working through different ideas but kept the output at 500x500 to keep the render times down. The plan was to someday re-render some of better experiments into larger formats to be printed for an art showing. I created hundreds of renderings that I was happy with but eventually lost the computer and source code base of these experiments (github wasn't a thing then). Still I kept a some of my favorite renderings on Google Drive and still enjoy looking at them from time to time. It remineds me of the the frenzied late nights I would stay up exploring code and art.

# Now some years later and Ethereum brings us a new kind of digital ownership with ERC-721, better known as non-fungable tokens. NFT marketplaces and Projects like [ArtBlocks](https://www.artblocks.io/) have helped breath new life int to the generative art form and as well as awaken the artist in me again. So I thought I would mint some of these early renderings to NFT's and put them up on a NFT market place to see what happens.

The sketches above are some of the earliest pieces. Back then my main objective was to use Processing and programming for just creative work and not the Flash based work I had to do every day. I was looking for anti-symitries in the sketches. Things that where beautifil but chaotic and counter the controled hand drawn sketches I spent so much of my childhood with.

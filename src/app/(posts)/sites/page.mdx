## Sites
<time>Nov 16th, 2023</time>

I started working on the web soon after Tim Berners Lee released it to the wide world and have worked on more sites than I can remember over the years. Below are images from some of those sites ordered by year. I put this up not so much for a portfolio of great design or engagement metrics but more so I can ***scroll*** down memory lane.

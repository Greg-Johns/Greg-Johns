## Greg Who???

This is the personal website of Greg Johns. The site's design and development have changed many times over for many years. Blog content has been written and deleted. Technology has been implemented and removed. The one thing that hasn't changed in the twenty somthing years I've been doing this is my endless obsession with handcrafting my own website that almost no one visits.

I'm a passionate creator, builder & tinkerer of things, most virtual some real. Some things useful somethings not so much. I worked in mom & pop shops to big corporate America, first as a designer, user experience engineer and later as a software engineer building web based solutions of a wide variety. Before my "career" I was a kid that read and drew a lot, an art student, a struggling artist until I found the safety and security of the 9 to 5 job. of my work tends to be playful in nature. I was a creative youth who excelled in art and spent a lot of time reading sci-fi and other fiction books. For a short time soon after art school I secured work in the comic book industry (a childhood dream) as an assistant inker on Marvel's reboot of Alpha Flight but as my 30's approached more of my free time was spent in designing and programming website for a new tech thing called the World Wide Web.

## About

This is the personal website of Greg Johns. I'm a long time web designer and developer that falls somewhere between to old for the social webs and micro blogging but young enough to still want to keep something of a "personal" social site or blog or whatever, it's my collection of projects, writings and other random stuff. The site's design & development have changed many times over many long years but the one thing that has remained the same in these twenty something years has been my obsession with designing & handcrafting my own site that no one visits.

Something about myself, I would like to think that I'm a passionate creator, builder and tinkerer of things. Most virtual some real. Some useful some not so much. I'm a software engineer and have been for a long time. I've worked for mom & pop shops to big corp America. First as a user experience designer and later as a software engineer where I now build web applications for CBRE an American commercial real estate services and investment firm. 

Aside from work I have a beautiful wife and daughter, two cats and a dog that keep me busy. I like being outdoors when I'm not with a computer where I'm usually somewhere down the crypto rabbit whole.

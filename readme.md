## About

This is the personal website of Greg Johns, a collection of projects, writings and other random stuff. The site's design & development have changed many times over many long years. I mean a many long years, like since the late 90's since before the word ***blog***, the blog's entries have been written & deleted, the technology has been implemented & removed, The one thing that has remained the same in these twenty something years has been my obsession with handcrafting my own website that almost no one visits.

Something about myself, I would like to think that I'm a passionate creator, builder and tinkerer of things. Most virtual some real. Some useful some not so much. I'm a software engineer and have been for a long time. I've worked for mom & pop shops to big corp America. First as a user experience designer and later as a software engineer where I now build web applications for CBRE an American commercial real estate services and investment firm. 

In my earlier days I was a kid that read a lot and drew a lot and got good enough to be called a **good** artist. Yada yada ya, art school, struggling artist, then about the time I was graduating I got hooked on this new technology thing called the world wide web, from there I learned to code, which paid more than the struggling artist and so here I am. There was a short time soon after art school that I managed to get work in the comic book industry as an assistant inker on Marvel's reboot of Alpha Flight. Comics had been a huge part of my childhood library so it was a dream job but was short lived and the web was getting bigger.

Aside from work I still sketch some, I play around making all sorts of computer generated art and stuff. I play guitar and piano some. I spend time with family and friends and try to make the most of life. Most of my fascination with the early days of the web faded as it converged into big data collecting companies of the *Web 2* but since Bitcoin, Ethereum and the decentralized *Web 3* showed up now I spend a unhealthy amount of time down the decentralized rabbit hole.

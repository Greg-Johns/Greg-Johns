## Greg Who?

This is the personal website of Greg Johns, a collection of projects, writings and other random stuff. The site's design & development have changed many times over many long years. I mean a many long years, like since the late 90's since before the word ***blog***, the blog's entries have been written & deleted, the technology has been implemented & removed, The one thing that has remained the same in these twenty something years has been my obsession with handcrafting my own website that almost no one visits.

Other than that I would like to think that I'm a passionate creator, builder and tinkerer of things. Most virtual some real. Some useful some... not so much. More dryly, I'm a software engineer and have been for a long time. I've worked for mom & pop shops to big corp America. First as a designer and later as a software engineer where I now building web based applications for CBRE an American commercial real estate services and investment firm. The abbreviation CBRE stands for Coldwell Banker Richard Ellis.

Before my **career** I was a kid that read a lot and drew a lot, enough to be called a **good** artist. Yada yada ya, art school, struggling artist, hooked on the early web 1, learned to code, paid more than the struggling artist so there you go. There was a short time soon after art school that I managed to get work in the comic book industry as an assistant inker on Marvel's reboot of Alpha Flight. Comics had been a huge part of my childhood library so it was a dream job but as my 30's approached more of my free time was spent in designing and programming website for a new tech thing called the World Wide Web.

Aside from work I still sketch some, I play around making all sorts of computer generated art and stuff. I play guitar and piano so so. I spend time with family and friends and try to make the most of life. Most of my fascination with the early days of the web faded as it converged into big data collecting companies of the *Web 2*. I've recovered some since blockchains, Bitcoin, Ethereum and the decentralized *Web 3* showed up now I spend a unhealthy amount of time down the decentralized rabbit hole.
